  summary: Shorts a given URL
  operationId: shortUrl
  description: |
    `Public`, `Member` & `Subscriber` Endpoint. API-Key not necessary.

    If `x-api-key` is supplied, then the short-urls are assigned to the user who owns the api-key. So you can query all short-urls and get more information, like the number of clicks. You can also remove them with the delete endpoint.

    Available shortener domains are: "xfive.de", "xtc5.de"

    If "custom_id" is passed with payload, random id will not be generated and your custom id will be used, if its available.

    Returns the short url.
