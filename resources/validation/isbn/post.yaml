    The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique.

    The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).
