  summary: Check if the given email is valid
  operationId: email
  description: |
    `Member` & `Subscriber` Endpoint. API-Key is needed.

    Valid payload options: "email", "allow_display_name", "require_display_name", "allow_utf8_local_part", "allow_ip_domain", "domain_specific_validation", "blacklisted_chars", "host_blacklist", "host_whitelist", "mx"   

    If **allow_display_name** is set to true, the validator will also match Display Name <email-address>. 

    If **require_display_name** is set to true, the validator will reject strings without the format Display Name <email-address>. 

    If **allow_utf8_local_part** is set to false, the validator will not allow any non-English UTF8 character in email address' local part. 
    
    If **allow_ip_domain** is set to true, the validator will allow IP addresses in the host part.

    If **domain_specific_validation** is true, some additional validation will be enabled, e.g. disallowing certain syntactically valid email addresses that are rejected by Gmail. 
    
    If **blacklisted_chars** receives a string, then the validator will reject emails that include any of the characters in the string, in the name part. 
    
    If **host_blacklist** is set to an array of strings and the part of the email after the @ symbol matches one of the strings defined in it, the validation fails. 
    
    If **host_whitelist** is set to an array of strings and the part of the email after the @ symbol matches none of the strings defined in it, the validation fails.
    
    if **mx** is set to true, the validator will do a mx record check on the domain of the email.
